# CML-RewardDistribution
Dedicated to the study of the reward distribution problem in collaborative machine learning (CML) using a collaborative generative model. .


## Load pretrained models for CR and CD algorithms.

A Deep Kernel is composed of :
	- Shared Feature Extractor module
	- Individual MLP layers
	- Gpytorch Module

For MNIST and CIFAR10, the Share Feature extractor module is a Convolutional VAE, and we will load some pretrained weights for it.
